# 🌿 Plant Disease Classifier API

This is a web-based application built using **FastAPI** that allows users to upload plant leaf images and receive predictions on possible plant diseases using a pre-trained TensorFlow model.

## 🚀 Features

- Upload plant leaf images to detect diseases.
- Predicts from 38 different plant disease classes.
- Web frontend with HTML upload interface.
- Clean API response with class name, confidence, and full raw scores.

## 🧠 Model

The model is a TensorFlow/Keras `.h5` file trained on a dataset such as **PlantVillage**. It expects images of shape **(224, 224, 3)**.

> ✅ You must place your model file as `model.h5` in the project root.
